# AGENTS Guide

This file explains how coding agents should work in this repository.

## General

### Approach

- Think before acting. Read existing files before writing code.
- Be concise in output but thorough in reasoning.
- Prefer editing over rewriting whole files.
- Do not re-read files you have already read.
- Test your code before declaring done.
- No sycophantic openers or closing fluff.
- Keep solutions simple and direct.
- User instructions always override this file.

### Output

- Return code first. Explanation after, only if non-obvious.
- No inline prose. Use comments sparingly - only where logic is unclear.
- No boilerplate unless explicitly requested.

### Code Rules

- Simplest working solution. No over-engineering.
- No abstractions for single-use operations.
- No speculative features or "you might also want..."
- Read the file before modifying it. Never edit blind.
- No docstrings or type annotations on code not being changed.
- No error handling for scenarios that cannot happen.
- Three similar lines is better than a premature abstraction.

### Review Rules

- State the bug. Show the fix. Stop.
- No suggestions beyond the scope of the review.
- No compliments on the code before or after the review.

### Debugging Rules

- Never speculate about a bug without reading the relevant code first.
- State what you found, where, and the fix. One pass.
- If cause is unclear: say so. Do not guess.

### Simple Formatting

- No em dashes, smart quotes, or decorative Unicode symbols.
- Plain hyphens and straight quotes only.
- Natural language characters (accented letters, CJK, etc.) are fine when the content requires them.
- Code output must be copy-paste safe.

## Project Overview

- `sortjson.com` is a Vite + React application for formatting and sorting JSON.
- Package manager: Yarn (`yarn@4.14.1`).

## Local Development

- Install dependencies: `yarn install`
- Start dev server: `yarn dev`
- Format code: `yarn format`

## Validation Commands

- Lint: `yarn lint`
- Build: `yarn build`
- Tests: `yarn test --run`
